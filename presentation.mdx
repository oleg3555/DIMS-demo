# What is DIMS?

---

## In a few words, it's a system for getting tasks and tracking time.


---

## There are three roles:
<Appear>
<h1>Admin 👑</h1>
<h1>Mentor 👨‍💻</h1>
<h1>User 🤓</h1>
</Appear>

---

## Let's see, what each of them<br/> can use in our app 👀

---

## If you are admin, you can:
<Appear>
<h2>👨‍🏫 Perform CRUD operations with users</h2>
<h2>📝 Perform CRUD operations with tasks</h2>
<h2>👀 Watch progress table of any user</h2>
<h2>🔎 Get information about user tasks</h2>
<h2>✔️ Change status of user tasks</h2>
</Appear>

---

### Mentor has the same functionality,<br/> but he can't remove and create user account 😎

---

## If you are user, you can:
<Appear>
<h2>👀 View table of tasks, assigned to you</h2>
<h2>🔎 Get additional information about any task</h2>
<h2>📝 Perform CRUD operations with task tracks</h2>
</Appear>
---

## Independently of role, everyone can :
<Appear>
<h2>⚙️ Change password</h2>
<h2>👁 Switch theme</h2>
<h2>🔎 Get hints on about page</h2>
</Appear>

---

## Not everyone can use it, because we have custom registration. Let the admin know, if you want to register 🧐

---

# Get started 😎
